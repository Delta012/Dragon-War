# Dragon War - A Dragon Overhaul

Dragon War is a complete and lightweight overhaul of Skyrimâ€™s dragons, designed to improve the overall experience of dragon fights. The mod makes dragons aggressive, faster and smarter, while expanding their elements and variants in a lore friendly way. It also makes Dragonrend even more useful, as it negates not only the capability of flying, but also their innate resistance to magic and weapons.
